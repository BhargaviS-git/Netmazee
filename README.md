NetMaze Explorer (Implement and manage virtual networking)
Design a hybrid networking environment where on-premises networks connect securely to Azure resources using Azure's networking capabilities, ensuring secure data transition and effective resource access controls.
•	Azure Services Used:
o	Azure Virtual Networks
o	Azure VPN Gateway
o	Network Security Groups (NSGs)
o	Azure Bastion
o	Azure Private Link
o	Azure DNS
o	Azure Load Balancer
Steps:
1.Azure Virtual Network Setup:
Login to Azure Account:
Set the Subscription (if necessary):
Create a Resource Group
Create the Virtual Network (VNet):
Create Multiple Subnets
  WebAppSubnet: 10.0.1.0/24 is for web app resources.
  DatabaseSubnet: 10.0.2.0/24 is for database resources.
  AdminSubnet: 10.0.3.0/24 is for administrative resources.
Verify VNet and Subnets:
Optional: Add Network Security Groups (NSGs)

2.On-Premises Network Simulation:
1. Create the Second Resource Group (if needed):
2. Create the Second Virtual Network (On-Premises Simulation VNet):
3. Create Subnets for the On-Premises Simulation VNet:
4. Establish VNet Peering between the Two VNets:
5. Verify VNet Peering:
6. Test Connectivity between VNets:

3.Secure Connectivity:
1. Create a Virtual Network Gateway in Azure (Main VNet)
     Create a Public IP Address for the VPN Gateway:
      Create the VPN Gateway Subnet (GatewaySubnet):
      Create the Virtual Network Gateway:
      Wait for the VPN Gateway to be created:
2. Create a Local Network Gateway (Simulated On-premises VNet)
    Create the Local Network Gateway:
3. Create the VPN Connection
     Create the VPN Connection:
4. Verify the VPN Connection
    Check VPN Connection Status:
    Test Connectivity:
4.Resource Deployment
1. Deploy a Web Server VM in the WebApp Subnet
    Create a Network Interface (NIC) for the VM:
   Create the VM in the WebApp Subnet:
2. Deploy a Database Server VM in the Database Subnet
    Create a NIC for the Database Server VM:
   Create the VM in the Database Subnet:
  3. Deploy an Admin/Management VM in the Admin Subnet
      Create a NIC for the Admin VM:
      Create the Admin VM:
4. Verify Communication Between VMs
     Ping Test Between VMs:
     Test Web Server Access:
    Check Database Access:
5. Network Access Control:
Step 1: Create NSGs for Each Subnet
           •  WebAppNSG for the WebApp Subnet
        •  DatabaseNSG for the Database Subnet
        •  AdminNSG for the Admin Subnet
Step 2: Define Inbound and Outbound Rules for Each NSG
Step 3: Associate NSGs with Subnets
Step 4: Verify the Rules and Test Connectivity
6. Secure Administrative Access:
Step 1: Create Azure Bastion Host
Step 2: Configure VMs for Bastion Access
Step 3: Access VMs Using Azure Bastion
Step 4: Security Considerations
7. Private Access to Azure PaaS Services:
Step 1: Create a Private Endpoint for Azure SQL Database
Step 2: Configure DNS for Private Endpoint
Step 3: Verify Connectivity to Azure SQL Database Over Private Endpoint
Step 4: Secure Access (Optional)
8.DNS and Load Balancing:
Part 1: Configure Azure DNS for Custom Domain Names
Part 2: Configure Azure Load Balancer to Distribute Traffic Across VMs in the WebApp Subnet
9. Performance and Security Testing:
1. Network Setup Overview
2. Simulate Data Transition Between On-Premises and Azure
Step 1: Set Up Resources for Data Transfer Testing
Step 2: Analyze the Performance
3. Simulate Unauthorized Access Attempts to Resources
Step 1: Setup Security Configurations
Step 2: Simulate Unauthorized Access Scenarios
Step 3: Monitor Logs and Metrics
4. Analyze and Refine Configurations
10. Monitoring and Auditing:
1. Enable Diagnostics and Monitoring for VPN Gateway
2. Enable Monitoring and Diagnostics for Network Security Groups (NSGs)
3. Enable Monitoring for Other Network Resources
4. Set Up Azure Network Watcher
